# Fabric and IPFS Interface

A Go-based interface for integrating Hyperledger Fabric and IPFS into existing applications.

This repository provides:
- A **blockchain interface**: reusable utilities and abstractions to connect to a Fabric network and submit/evaluate transactions.
- **Chaincode packages**: smart contracts specific to the research use case.
- An **IPFS interface**: integration helpers to interact with IPFS for decentralized storage.
